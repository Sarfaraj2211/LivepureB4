    <span>Outstanding Universal Value
    </span>
    <p>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses
         nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan  
        in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, 
        with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its 
        cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and  
        Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. 
        For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, 
        dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia 
        and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
