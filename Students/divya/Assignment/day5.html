                The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres
                (115
                ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical
                "drum"
                it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called
                an
                onion dome or amrud (guava dome).[21] The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to
                accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks)
                placed at
                its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical.[22]
                Their
                columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative
                spires
                (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The
                lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded
                finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.[23]

                The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the
                early
                19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu
                decorative elements.[24] The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point
                heavenward.[25]

                The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for
                symmetry. They were designed as working minarets— a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin
                to
                call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two
                working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a
                chattri
                that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a
                lotus
                design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that
                in
                the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material
                from
                the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.[26]
