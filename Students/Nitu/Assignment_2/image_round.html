    <div id="discription">
      <h3>Architecture and design</h3>
      <p>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture.
        Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of
        Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[17] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens
        and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and
        Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi.</p>
      <h3>Exterior decorations</h3>
      <p>he exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area
        changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint,
        stucco, stone inlays or carvings</p>
      <h3>Symbolism</h3>
      <p>Due to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has
        become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.[49]

        Along with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan's wealth and power, and
        the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule.</p>
