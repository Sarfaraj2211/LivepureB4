     <h2><i>A Light Exists in Spring</i></h2><br>
     <pre>
         A Light exists in 
         Not Present on the Year
           At any other period-
        When March is Scarcely here<br>  
        A color Stands abroad
          On Solitary Fields
        That science cannot overtake
          But Human Nature Feels.<br>
          It waits upon the Lawn,
         It Shows the Furthest Tree
        Upon The Furthest Slope You Know
        It almost Speaks to you.
     </pre>
