                <h2>Missile man of India</h2>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October
                    1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
                    served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                    raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
                    He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly
                    at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
                    Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                    space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to
                    be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                    missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first
                    since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]</p>
